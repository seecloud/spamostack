Configuring spamostack
----------------------

Please, configure your settings by changing config file in etc/ folder.
File ``openrc`` is needed for connecting to your cloud, and file ``conf.json`` is needed for configuring pipelines


Configuring keystone
--------------------

Example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {"pipe1":
     {"keystone":
       {
         "projects":
         {
          "create": [60, 1, 1],
          "update": [60, 1, 1]
         },
         "users":
         {
          "create": [60, 2, 1],
          "update": [120, 2, 2]
         }
       }
     }
   }

That means, that spamostack should:

- Create 1 project in 60 seconds and do it once
- Update 1 project in 60 seconds and do it once
- Create 2 users in 60 seconds and do it once
- Update 2 users in 120 seconds and do it twice

Using spamostack
----------------

1. Run ``source /etc/openrc``
2. Just run it with ``spamostack``. Config file with pipelines will be read from etc/ folder
